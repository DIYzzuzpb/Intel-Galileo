Galileo is a microcontroller board based on the Intel Quark SoC X1000 Application Processor, 
a 32-bit Intel Pentium-class system on a chip.

Digital pins 0 to 13 (and the adjacent AREF and GND pins), Analog inputs 0 to 5, the power header, 
ICSP header, and the UART port pins (0 and 1), 
are all in the same locations as on the Arduino Uno R3. 

工作所需电压(3.3V / 5.0V);
The core operating voltage of Galileo is 3.3V. 
板上有一jumper(IOREF), 可通过跳线帽切换I/O的参考电压为3.3V / 5.0V;
